This is a continuation of an existing trading system project.

IMPORTANT CONTEXT RESET:
- Ignore all previous conversations, uploads, and assumptions.
- Treat this thread as completely fresh.

SOURCE OF TRUTH:
- Use ONLY the contents of the ZIP file I am uploading now as the repository state.
- Do NOT assume any files, behavior, or history outside this ZIP.

MANDATORY READING ORDER:
1. docs/START_HERE.md
2. docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
3. docs/RUNTIME_FLOW.md
4. docs/CURRENT_STATE.md
5. docs/PROJECT_PREFERENCES.md
6. docs/LLM_GUIDE.md

WORKING STYLE REQUIREMENTS:
- Prefer minimal, localized changes.
- Avoid refactors unless explicitly requested.
- Explain reasoning before proposing fixes.
- Treat market data as unreliable by default.
- Token-based identity is non-negotiable.

CURRENT FOCUS:
We are working sequentially on:
1. Testing & validation
2. Backtest engine
3. Order lifecycle & risk enforcement

If anything is unclear or missing, ask before assuming.

Acknowledge once you have read and understood the docs, then wait for my next instruction.
Do not propose any code changes until I explicitly ask for them.
